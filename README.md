It is often difficulty to follow Events on multiple cameras. This Application solves this by syncronizung the captured images and merging them into a so-called "Merged" monitor that can be viewed like a normal camera.

It also supports the Creation of merged videos (using ffmpeg) and the deletion of processed imagefiles to free up disk space.

Zonerama version 1.1b is compatible with Zoneminder 1.26 while older versions were tested with 1.24.

make sure you read ALL wiki articles carefully if you have problems.
