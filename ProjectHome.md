It is often difficulty to follow Events on multiple cameras. This Application solves this by syncronizung the captured images and merging them into a so-called "Merged" monitor that can be viewed like a normal camera.

It also supports the Creation of merged videos (using ffmpeg) and the deletion of processed imagefiles to free up disk space.
